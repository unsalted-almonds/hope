 * Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is

 * 
 * Notice

 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 * 
 * Example For example, given array S = [-1 2 1 -4], and target = 1. The sum
 * that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
